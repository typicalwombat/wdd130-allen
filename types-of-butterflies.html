  <h1>Types of Butterflies</h1>
  <p>Butterflies are classified into 7 different families. Each family has unique characteristics and beautiful species.</p>

       —hence the name brush-footed. Their wings are often bold, bright, and 
       patterned.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Monarch butterflies migrate thousands of miles, making one of 
      the longest insect migrations in the world.</p>

    <h4>Common Members: Eastern Tiger Swallowtail, Black Swallowtail, Giant Swallowtail</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Elegant butterflies with long tail-like extensions, Swallowtails are large,

  <section>
    <h2>5. Riodinidae – The Metalmarks</h2>
    <hr class="split-family">
    <img class="family" src="/images/Riodinidae.jpg" alt="Riodinidae Butterfly">
    <br>
    <h4>Common Members: Northern Metalmark, Mexican Metalmark</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Tiny butterflies with shiny, metallic markings, Metalmarks are named for the 
      metallic-looking spots on their wings. They are diverse but less commonly seen 
      compared to other families.</p>

    <h2>6. Hesperiidae – The Skippers</h2>

    <h4>Common Members: Silver-Spotted Skipper, Fiery Skipper, Sachem</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Fast, darting butterflies that look a bit like moths, Skippers get their name from their quick, skipping flight.
