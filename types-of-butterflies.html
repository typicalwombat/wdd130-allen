  <h1>Types of Butterflies</h1>
  <p>Butterflies are classified into 7 different families. Each family has unique characteristics and beautiful species.</p>

  <!-- Family 1 -->
  <section>
    <h2>1. Nymphalidae - The Brush-Footed Butterflies</h2>
    <img id="family-img" src="/images/image.png" alt="Swallowtail Butterfly">
    <p>The largest butterfly family

Nymphalidae butterflies are known for their reduced front legs, which are covered in tiny hairs and look like brushes—hence the name brush-footed. Their wings are often bold, bright, and patterned.

Common Members: Monarchs, Viceroys, Painted Ladies, Admirals, Fritillaries
Key Features:
-Front pair of legs too small for walking
-Strong, fast fliers
-Wide variety of colors and patterns
-Frequently seen in gardens and fields</p>

<p>Fun Fact: Monarch butterflies migrate thousands of miles, making one of the longest insect migrations in the world.</p>

    <h2>2. Pieridae – The Whites and Sulphurs</h2>
    <img id="family-img" src="/images/image.png" alt="Pieridae Butterfly">
    <p>Light-colored butterflies that love sunny open spaces

Pieridae butterflies are usually white, yellow, or pale orange. They’re common in meadows, yards, and open fields.

Common Members: Cabbage White, Clouded Sulphur, Orange Sulphur
Key Features:
-Mostly white or yellow wings
-Dark dots or tips along the wings
-Quick, fluttering flight patterns
-Often attracted to flowering plants</p>

<p>Fun Fact: The Cabbage White is one of the most widespread butterflies in the world and is often the first species new butterfly watchers recognize.</p>

  <!-- Family 3 -->
  <section>
    <h2>3. Lycaenidae – The Blues, Coppers, and Hairstreaks</h2>
    <img id="family-img" src="/images/image.png" alt="Lycaenidae Butterfly">
    <p>Small but brilliantly colored butterflies

This family includes some of the smallest butterflies—and some of the brightest. Their wings often sparkle in blues, purples, or metallic tones.

Common Members: Spring Azure, Eastern Tailed-Blue, American Copper, Hairstreaks
Key Features:
-Generally small (about the size of a quarter)
-Many species have iridescent wings
-Caterpillars often have mutualistic relationships with ants
-Delicate, fast wingbeats</p>

<p>Fun Fact: Hairstreaks sometimes have tiny “false heads” on their wings to confuse predators.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Family 4 -->
  <section>
    <h2>4. Papilionidae – The Swallowtails</h2>
    <img id="family-img" src="/images/image.png" alt="Lycaenidae Butterfly">
    <p>Elegant butterflies with long tail-like extensions

Swallowtails are large, graceful butterflies recognized by the “tails” on their hindwings. They are often brightly colored and prefer warm habitats.

Common Members: Eastern Tiger Swallowtail, Black Swallowtail, Giant Swallowtail
Key Features:
-Large wingspan and striking colors
-Tail-like extensions on hindwings
-Caterpillars have an organ called an osmeterium that emits a smell to deter predators
-Found in gardens, woodlands, and meadows</p>

<p>Fun Fact: The Giant Swallowtail is the largest butterfly in North America.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Family 5 -->
  <section>
    <h2>5. Riodinidae – The Metalmarks</h2>
    <img id="family-img" src="/images/image.png" alt="Riodinidae Butterfly">
    <p>Tiny butterflies with shiny, metallic markings

Metalmarks are named for the metallic-looking spots on their wings. They are diverse but less commonly seen compared to other families.

Common Members: Northern Metalmark, Mexican Metalmark
Key Features:
-Small and delicate
-Wings often contain silver or bronze “metallic” spots
-Prefer warm, sunny habitats
-Sit with wings open more often than closed</p>

<p>Fun Fact: Some species mimic the wing patterns of toxic butterflies to avoid predators.</p>

  <!-- Family 6 -->
  <section>
    <h2>6. Hesperiidae – The Skippers</h2>
    <img id="family-img" src="/images/image.png" alt="Hesperiidae Butterfly">
    <p>Fast, darting butterflies that look a bit like moths

Skippers get their name from their quick, skipping flight. They have thicker bodies and hooked antennae, which make them look different from other butterflies.

Common Members: Silver-Spotted Skipper, Fiery Skipper, Sachem
Key Features:
-Thick, fuzzy bodies
-Hooked or curved antenna tips
-Rapid, zigzag flight
-Usually brown, tan, orange, or gold</p>
